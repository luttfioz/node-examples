We will create a sample express application with express-generator. To do this we should
install express-generator module globally.  
> npm install -g express-generator  

To create a skeleton application use express command:  
> express shopping-services-app -e

Thus an express application with ejs templation engine support will be created. Let
continue to install dependencies:  
> cd shopping-services-app  
> npm install  
> npm start
